## üéì What is NSQ?
NSQ is a realtime distributed messaging platform.

**Features**
* support distributed topologies with no SPOF
* horizontally scalable (no brokers, seamlessly add more nodes to the cluster)
* low-latency push based message delivery (performance)
* combination load-balanced and multicast style message routing
* excel at both streaming (high-throughput) and job oriented (low-throughput) workloads
* primarily in-memory (beyond a high-water mark messages are transparently kept on disk)
* runtime discovery service for consumers to find producers (nsqlookupd)
* transport layer security (TLS)
* data format agnostic
* few dependencies (easy to deploy) and a sane, bounded, default configuration
* simple TCP protocol supporting client libraries in any language
* HTTP interface for stats, admin actions, and producers (no client library needed to publish)
* integrates with statsd for realtime instrumentation
* robust cluster administration interface (nsqadmin)
